One of the biggest events that we organize for our SHPE Jr. Chapters is Noche de Ciencias. Typical outreach events that the team organizes are classroom visits, student panels, campus tours and fundraisers. My goal is to show others just how capable and resilient they can be, regardless of challenges or factors that may set them aside from the crowd. I am looking forward to developing new activities and events to help make an engineering-centric curriculum accessible to students who don\'t have the chance to explore STEM at an early age. \n\nOutside of SHPE and my studies, you can find me either at Cal Poly's machine shops creating new projects or at Starbucks working as a barista! SHPE has been a huge part of my journey here at Cal Poly, and I hope our new members can say the same. I look forward to meeting you all and having you join us at our outreach events this year!  `,
