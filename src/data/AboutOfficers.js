      "\nMy hometown is Bakersfield, California. Some of my hobbies include playing tennis, going on walks, and watching Disney movies. My ideal future career would be in the automotive industry. Being in SHPE will help me accomplish many of my career goals. The networking provided through company representatives at meetings is what I like the most about SHPE. I hope to get more students into SHPE in order for them to take advantage of all the opportunities in this great organization."
