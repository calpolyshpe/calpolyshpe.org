            <WhatIs question={"Our Jr chapters"} response={"Our first SHPE Jr chapter at Pioneer Valley High School was established in 2013, followed by Santa Maria High School in 2017.

Currently, we are looking to expand to other schools to outreach to as many students as we can and help all schools near San Luis Obispo learn about STEM majors."}/>
